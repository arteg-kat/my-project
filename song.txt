Darling, I can show you where my love hides
It’s a heartbeat, on a hard drive
Yeah, I’m dancing with your soul in my sights
It’s a showdown, in the spotlight
Honey, glamour’s got me out of my mind
Like a kill-switch, on my backside
And the camera’s got you frozen in time
Like a save state, in a game file
