Darling, I can show you where my love hides
It’s a heartbeat, on a hard drive
Yeah, I’m dancing with your soul in my sights
It’s a showdown, in the spotlight
Honey, glamour’s got me out of my mind
Like a kill-switch, on my backside
And the camera’s got you frozen in time
Like a save state, in a game file
I’m dreaming like no Dreemurr ever could
There’s my name, up in lights
Fifteen minutes won’t suffice, baby
I’m sorry but it’s for the greater good
Raise the stakes, pick a fight
And these ratings might ignite, baby
You got a lot of nerve my friend
What day and age you think we’re living in?
You’ve got a lot to learn human
Did you really think the doc' was in?
Darling, I can show you where my love hides
It’s a heartbeat, on a hard drive
Yeah, I’m dancing with your soul in my sights
It’s a showdown, in the spotlight
Honey, glamour’s got me out of my mind
Like a kill-switch, on my backside
And the camera’s got you frozen in time
Like a save state, in a game file
Electric personality, persona fabulosity
With romance, bloodshed, and intrigue
Give the people what they need
A star, for humanity
My face, on a million screens
Now turn your heel, but don’t you flee
Who needs arms with legs like these?
Get a load of my sequins
Strut my stuff, you know I’m glammorin’
You’re gonna go to the dungeon
Do you really think that I won’t win?
Darling, I can show you where my love hides
It’s a heartbeat, on a hard drive
Yeah, I’m dancing with your soul in my sights
It’s a showdown, in the spotlight
Honey, glamour’s got me out of my mind
Like a kill-switch, on my backside
And the camera’s got you frozen in time
Like a save state, in a game file
